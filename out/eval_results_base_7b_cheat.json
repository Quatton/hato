Based on these observations, wards like Toshima, Nerima, or Itabashi are strong candidates, as they have many neighborhoods fitting this profile.

The utilitarian lamp posts and overhead wiring suggest a ward that is primarily residential but with some commercial activity, likely near major roads. The lack of ornate or historical features and the utilitarian municipal design point to a ward that is not in the city center but still within the 23 wards. Wards like Kita, Toshima, or Nerima often have such characteristics. The street width and density are more typical of inner-city wards, which rules out more suburban wards. The presence of medium-rise buildings suggests areas that have seen some redevelopment but retain older layouts.\n</reasoning>\n\n<ward>Kita</ward>"
