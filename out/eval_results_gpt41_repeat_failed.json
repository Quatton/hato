The architecture is urban and dense, typical of central Tokyo, with a mix of residential and commercial properties. The road appears clean and well-maintained, and there are bicycles parked nearby. Japanese signage is visible, reflecting a typical Tokyo ward environment.</observation>\n<reasoning>Denny's restaurants are common in central areas, and the surrounding architecture suggests a dense, urban business-residential mix, which is characteristic of wards like Shinjuku, Chiyoda, Chuo, or Minato. However, the level of modern development and the relatively quiet nature of the street — not overcrowded like parts of Shibuya or Shinjuku — make me consider a business-oriented ward. Noting the style of garden and signage (partially saying '堀留'), I suspect it's related to the Nihombashi Horidomecho area, which is in Chuo ward.</reasoning>\n<ward>Chuo</ward>",

The wide road or elevated structure hints at suburban parts of Tokyo rather than the very central business districts. Wards like Koto, Edogawa, and Ota are known for having both residential mid-rises and large infrastructure such as highways or train lines. Given the greenery and the appearance of mid-to-late 20th-century residential buildings, it suggests a residential area in a ward like Koto, which has many such developments bordering major roads and waterways. Among the possible options, Koto Ward fits the observed characteristics well.</reasoning>\n<ward>Koto</ward>",

Koto Ward is especially notable for its mix of warehouses and docks, and the appearance of the facilities aligns well with the Toyosu/Tatsumi/Shinonome area in Koto.",
