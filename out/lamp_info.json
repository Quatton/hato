    "lamp_info": "Certainly! Here’s a structured analysis and summary built from the observations, with distinct grouping based on style, structure, color, and context. All significant variations have been extracted to ensure that no key pattern or type is missed.\n\n---\n\n## Key Groupings of Street Lamps in Ota Ward, Tokyo\n\n### **Group 1: Purely Utilitarian, Pole-Mounted Fixtures (Most Prevalent)**\n**Features:**\n- **Pole:** Mounted on multi-purpose utility poles (concrete or metal, typically gray or medium brown, sometimes white or black).\n- **Lamp Head:** Small, plain, compact fixtures — most commonly rectangular/oval/cylindrical box, sometimes drum or semi-cylindrical.\n- **Mounting:** Lamp arm is a short, straight or subtly curved bracket; attaches at mid- to two-thirds of pole height.\n- **Color:** Lamp housing is metallic gray, off-white, or aluminum; poles are concrete gray, metallic, or brown.\n- **Style:** Strictly functional, utilitarian, minimal — **no ornamentation** or historic flourishes.\n- **Lighting:** Downward-facing, designed to focus light on street/sidewalk, typically LED or fluorescent.\n- **Integration:** Overhead utility wiring often shares pole with lamp.\n- **Environment:** Residential side streets, narrow roadways, and dense urban infrastructure.\n- **Visual Effect:** Blends into background, unobtrusive, purely for illumination and safety.\n\n---\n\n### **Group 2: Standalone Metal Poles — Minimal Modernism**\n**Features:**\n- **Pole:** Slim, cylindrical, made of metal or aluminum, painted gray, silver, dark gray, or black; some are white, olive green or muted green-grey.\n- **Lamp Arm:** \n    - Single, straight or gently curved arm (horizontal, slightly angled, or gooseneck).\n    - In some cases, a pronounced arch (gooseneck), especially on pedestrian/park paths.\n    - Occasional Y-shaped or wishbone split arms for multi-lane/median lamps.\n- **Lamp Head:** \n    - Compact oval, rectangular, or dome-shaped.\n    - Sometimes flat/boxy, other times slightly cone- or lantern-shaped.\n- **Height:** Ranges from moderate (4–6 meters, for neighborhood/sidewalks) to very tall (10m+ for arterials/industrial zones).\n- **Style:** Modern, minimalist, non-ornamental. Focuses on efficiency and visual unobtrusiveness.\n- **Lighting:** Downward orientation, often LED; for broader or roadway-scale illumination, heads are larger or arms split.\n- **Placement:** \n    - Directly onto sidewalk/curb or in medians for major roadways.\n    - Regular interval spacing for even light distribution.\n    - No secondary features (banners, flowerpots).\n\n---\n\n### **Group 3: Lantern/Lantern-Inspired (Traditional-Modern Hybrid)**\n**Features:**\n- **Pole:** Metal, painted muted green-grey or (rarely) black, blends into the residential/commercial background.\n- **Lamp Head:** \n    - Circular or hexagonal/octagonal \"lantern\" with a cap — sometimes pagoda-inspired (with orange/burnt red covers).\n    - Black grid/cage or frame around frosted glass/plastic enclosure.\n    - Wider cap, referencing traditional chochin lanterns; occasionally two lanterns on one post, facing opposite directions.\n- **Lighting:** Designed for downward glow; may give warmer light.\n- **Placement:** \n    - Integrated into utility poles or as standalone posts.\n    - Most common in older \"shotengai\" (shopping streets), select residential lanes.\n- **Style:** Modern reinterpretation of Japanese tradition — subtle decorative appeal, but not ornate.\n- **Distinctive:** The only group exhibiting color accents and referential shapes; stands out against the otherwise strictly utilitarian lamps.\n\n---\n\n### **Group 4: Twin-Globes (Retro-Modern Shopping Street Style)**\n**Features:**\n- **Pole:** Metal, painted light beige or pale bronze.\n- **Arms:** Two outward curved arms at the top, symmetrical.\n- **Lamp Head:** Large, round, white glass globes (\"milk glass\"), paired side by side.\n- **Style:** Slightly decorative, faint retro-modern charm (but not ornate); minor decorative sign brackets possible below lamps.\n- **Placement:** Seen in select residential/small commercial mixed-use streets, often near shopfronts.\n- **Distinctive:** Most \"decorative\" among all—still restrained compared to lamp designs in historic districts.\n\n---\n\n### **Group 5: Park/Pathway Lamps (Lantern-Like or Modern Gooseneck)**\n**Features:**\n- **Pole:** Usually medium height, painted black or very dark brown; sometimes gently tapered or standard cylindrical.\n- **Lamp Head:** Rounded, sometimes globe or lantern-shaped, domed or hemisphere; modern or slightly retro (\"mild park aesthetic\").\n- **Arm:** Vertical or smoothly curved gooseneck style.\n- **Style:** Functional but with a very light nod to classical park lamps — **no ornate or historical finishes**, only subtle.\n- **Placement:** Park paths, walkways, landscaped areas; spaced for pedestrian visibility.\n- **Distinctive:** Subtle modern \"park\" design, rarely seen with overt decorative details.\n\n---\n\n## **Key Commonalities Across All Groups**\n\n- **General Lack of Ornamentation:** The overwhelming trend is minimalism and utility — most lamps are strictly functional, emphasizing durability, maintainability, and cost-efficiency.\n- **Color Palette:** Restricted to muted, neutral tones: metallic gray, weathered brown, black, dark green-grey, white. Rare exceptions with burnt orange lantern caps or light beige poles.\n- **Mounting:** Majority are pole-mounted, either as dedicated streetlamps or, more frequently, as attachments to multi-use utility poles (especially on side streets and residential roads).\n- **Lamp Head Shapes:** Rectangular, oval, dome/hemisphere, cylinder, or hexagonal/octagonal lantern forms. Round glass globes mark the only whimsical/retro motif.\n- **Technological Modernity:** Lamp heads reflect upgrades to LED or fluorescent technology; old sodium-vapor styles are being replaced but still evident in shape/design choices.\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Group         | Placement/Integration            | Pole Color/Material             | Lamp Head Shape/Style                | Distinct Features                              | Context           |\n|---------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Utilitarian   | Mounted on utility poles         | Concrete gray, brown             | Small box/oval/cylinder              | Short arms, no ornamentation                   | Residential       |\n| Minimalist    | Standalone (sometimes split arms)| Metallic gray, black, white      | Oval/rectangular/cone/dome           | Unadorned, sometimes Y-shape split for medians | Major streets     |\n| Lantern       | Utility poles/standalone         | Muted green-grey/black           | Circlular/hex/oct lantern (caged)    | Burnt orange cap, black cage, trad. reference  | Shotengai/resid.  |\n| Twin-Globe    | Standalone pole                  | Light beige, pale bronze         | Large round white globes (2 per pole)| Faintly decorative, short arms                 | Shop streets      |\n| Park/Pathway  | Standalone or park paths         | Black or dark brown (tapered)    | Rounded/lantern, domed/hemisphere    | Minimalist gooseneck; very mild deco           | Parks, Walkways   |\n\n---\n\n## **Comprehensive Summary of Ota Ward Street Lamps**\n\n1. **The dominant style is purely utilitarian:** Most lamps are attached directly to multi-purpose utility poles (gray concrete or brown metal) with short, curved brackets; lamp heads are small, functional, and metallic in color (gray, off-white, or aluminum). There is virtually no ornamentation. Utility poles double for lighting and wiring, integrating seamlessly into Tokyo’s dense urban infrastructure.\n\n2. **Modern, standalone minimalist poles** line major streets and intersections, finished in neutral grays, silvers, black, white, or greenish tones, with a single, sometimes split (Y-shaped), arm and a plain rectangular, oval, or dome lamp fixture. These support efficient illumination for wide roadways or sidewalks and are free of any historic or decorative detail.\n\n3. **Occasional traditional-modern hybrid lamps**—primarily on shotengai, select residential lanes, and some older commercial streets—have lantern-like heads with pagoda-style orange covers and black metal cage frames. These evoke classic Japanese lanterns but remain modern in construction and restraint.\n\n4. **In select shopping areas,** twin globe lamps (side-by-side milk-glass spheres) mounted on beige-light metal poles appear, displaying faint retro-modern charm. Minor decorative sign brackets may be present, but full ornamentation is absent.\n\n5. **Park and walkway lighting** employs standalone black/dark brown posts with unobtrusive gooseneck arms and dome or globe heads—again, strictly minimalist with only a faint nod to classic park lamp design.\n\n**In conclusion:**  \nOta ward’s street lamps display a consistently restrained, functional modernism, with most lamps engineered for unobtrusiveness and infrastructural efficiency. The only significant decorative deviations—lantern-motif heads and twin-globe lamps—are confined to traditional shopping streets or heritage-conscious residential areas. The palette is strictly neutral, with exceedingly rare color highlights. All feature modern illumination technology, emphasizing public safety, energy efficiency, and seamless cityscape integration over ornament."

    "lamp_info": "Let's carefully analyze the compiled observations about street lamps in Adachi, Tokyo. I’ll cross-reference the detailed reports, especially focusing on features like **color, shape, mounting method, lamp head style, decorative elements, and setting**, to find distinct and recurring patterns. I'll group the lamps according to their characteristics and summarize every key variation observed.\n\n---\n\n## **Thought Process and Cross-referencing**\n\n### **1. Core Patterns & Recurring Features**\n- **Color:**  \n  - The overwhelming majority are **metallic grey, silver, unpainted galvanized steel, or concrete grey**.\n  - Some are **matte black**, **muted brown/bronze**, **pale green**, and **beige**; these are rare and more context-specific (e.g., new residential developments, parks, bridges, specific residential streets).\n\n- **Mounting Structure:**  \n  - Most lamps are **mounted directly on utility poles** (either **concrete or metal**) that also carry electrical and telecommunication wires.\n  - Others are **dedicated poles** (metal, sometimes colored), especially in newer, redeveloped, or more ornamental environments.\n  - There exist **short, bollard-style lamps** in parks/walkways for pedestrian lighting.\n\n- **Pole Shape and Style:**  \n  - **Cylindrical, slender, and straight poles** are ubiquitous.\n  - Occasionally, poles have a **gentle curve or right-angle (“gooseneck” or “L”-shaped)** at the top for the lamp arm.\n\n- **Lamp Head Shape:**  \n  - **Elongated, oval, rectangular, boxy, or cylindrical** lamp heads dominate.\n  - Heads are almost always **simple, unobtrusive, and downward-facing**.\n  - Bullet-shaped, dome-shaped, and lantern (rare) also appear, depending on site and lamp age.\n\n- **Decorative Elements:**  \n  - **None in the vast majority** – lamps are extremely utilitarian, with zero ornamentation or historic reference.\n  - **Exception:** Occasionally, there are **lantern-style, bronze/brown, short garden lamps** in pocket parks or pedestrian walkways, made to be decorative and provide ambient lighting.\n\n- **Lighting Technology:**  \n  - Typically **LED**, sometimes **fluorescent or sodium vapor** (modernization ongoing).\n  - Almost always shielded to direct light downward and minimize pollution.\n\n- **Usage Context:**  \n  - Distinct rarer types in **parks (short, black bollards)** and **bridges (tall, beige or pale gray, dedicated roadway lamps)**.\n  - Different styles for **highways/arterials** and **small residential streets**.\n  - On some small streets, **no lamp may be present** at all—just bare utility poles.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Grouping by Distinct Types and Their Characteristics**\n\n#### **Group 1: Utility Pole-mounted, Standard Municipal Lamps**\n- **Mounting:** Almost always on concrete or galvanized steel utility poles, multi-use (electricity + lighting).\n- **Color:** Grey/metallic/steel/concrete.\n- **Pole Shape:** Cylindrical, straight, sometimes slight taper, sometimes with gentle curve/gooseneck.\n- **Lamp Head:** Small, simple, metallic, elongated oval/bullet/rectangular/cylindrical; generally horizontal or downward facing.\n- **Style:** Strictly utilitarian/minimalist.\n- **Lighting Tech:** Usually LED or high-pressure sodium.\n- **Distinct Features:** Sometimes weathered, usually well-maintained; may occur in variants (curved gooseneck, L-arm, etc.).\n- **Context:** Overwhelmingly dominant on residential/neighborhood streets and secondary/commercial roads.\n\n#### **Group 2: Dedicated Steel Poles for Highway, Arterial Roads, and Bridges**\n- **Mounting:** Standalone, tall, smooth metal posts.\n- **Color:** Grey, metallic, pale beige or off-white (bridges sometimes slightly distinct).\n- **Pole Shape:** Tall, slender, straight, sometimes with right-angle arm or upwards bend.\n- **Lamp Head:** Boxy, rectangular, or squarish heads; minimalist.\n- **Style:** Modern/industrial, absolutely no ornamentation.\n- **Distinct Features:** Higher placement, regular spacing along wide roads/bridges for maximum coverage.\n\n#### **Group 3: Modern, Matte Black Street Lamps (New Residential Developments)**\n- **Mounting:** Dedicated steel/aluminum posts.\n- **Color:** Matte black.\n- **Pole Shape:** Square cross-section or slim cylinder; clean vertical or right-angle arm.\n- **Lamp Head:** Squared box, flat, angular; matches post color.\n- **Style:** Hyper-modern, minimal, geometric.\n- **Context:** Seen around new developments/urban renewal zones.\n\n#### **Group 4: Bollard-style Pedestrian/Pathway Lamps**\n- **Mounting:** Short, squat posts/bollards, knee-height.\n- **Color:** Usually black.\n- **Pole Shape:** Short cylinder.\n- **Lamp Head:** Top or band near the head, soft/diffused light.\n- **Context:** Parks, riverside walkways, greenways; not for vehicle roads.\n\n#### **Group 5: Decorative Lantern-style Garden/Pocket Park Lamps (Rare)**\n- **Mounting:** Short, brown/bronze/black post, traditional lantern head.\n- **Color:** Dark brown/bronze.\n- **Shape:** Slender, hexagonal lantern, clear/frosted glass, finial/top.\n- **Style:** Westernized vintage; decorative for ambiance.\n- **Context:** Small parks, between apartment buildings, benches.\n\n#### **Group 6: Paint-Varied Poles in Older or Special Residential Areas**\n- **Mounting:** Dedicated poles.\n- **Color:** Pale (muted) green, possibly due to neighborhood differentiation.\n- **Pole Shape:** Simple cylinder, low profile.\n- **Lamp Head:** Small, rectangular, boxy, downward tilting.\n- **Distinct Features:** Identical minimalism, color adaptation to local context/environment.\n- **Context:** Narrow side streets, low-traffic residential zones.\n\n#### **Group 7: No Lamp Present**\n- Sometimes utility poles **lack any attached street lamp**—notable on very minor roads or older neighborhoods.\n\n---\n\n## **Comprehensive Summary for Adachi Ward’s Street Lamps**\n\n### **General Patterns:**\n- **Overwhelming Utilitarianism:**  \n  The majority of street lamps in Adachi are ultra-functional, lacking decorative elements and focusing entirely on practical, cost-effective, and durable lighting.\n- **Unified Color Scheme:**  \n  Metallic grey/silver and concrete gray dominate, but matte black, brown, beige, green, and bronze do occur in specific contexts.\n- **Minimalist Shapes:**  \n  Lamp heads almost always are simple horizontal tubes, rectangles, ovals, bullets, or cylinders.\n- **Mounting Practices:**  \n  Most lamps are attached to utility poles (concrete or steel) already supporting power/telecom lines; others stand as independent dedicated lamp posts on highways, bridges, and redevelopments.\n- **Lighting Technology:**  \n  Modernization means most lamps are LED, but some older sodium/fluorescent fixtures persist.\n\n### **Distinct Groups Identified in Adachi:**\n\n| **Group** | **Color** | **Pole & Mounting** | **Lamp Head** | **Style** | **Context/Setting** | **Notes** |\n|-----------|-----------|---------------------|---------------|-----------|---------------------|-----------|\n| 1. Utility-pole Municipal | Grey, metallic, concrete | Cylindrical, concrete/steel utility pole | Oval, rectangular, bullet, cylinder, downward | Ultra-utilitarian | Almost all residential/commercial roads | Most common |\n| 2. Highway/Bridge Dedicated | Metallic silver, grey, beige | Straight/tall metal pole, right-angle/arched arm | Boxy/rectangular, shielded | Utilitarian, industrial | Highways, arterial roads, bridges | Tallest, wide area lighting |\n| 3. Modern Matte Black | Matte black | Square/cylindrical, modern pole | Square, flat, box head | Modern minimalist | New residential dev’ts | Geometric, contemporary |\n| 4. Short Bollard/Pathway | Black | Short, squat cylinder | Band/top, low output | Minimalist | Parks, riverside paths | For pedestrian use only |\n| 5. Decorative Lantern (Rare) | Brown/bronze | Short, slim, decorative pole | Hexagonal lantern | Vintage, western | Pocket parks/walkways | Only in small gardens, not roads |\n| 6. Pale Green/Colored | Pale green (sometimes) | Plain cylindrical, painted | Small rectangle, boxy | Minimalist, context-specific | Some older/unique districts | Not the norm, but present |\n| 7. No Lamp Present | N/A | Concrete utility pole | N/A | N/A | Minor quiet streets | Just utility—no light |\n\n### **Key Takeaways:**\n- **Functional Minimalism Defines Adachi’s Streetscape:**  \n  Adachi is characterized by its practical, maintenance-friendly, and visually unobtrusive street lighting infrastructure.\n- **Neighborhood Variation is Limited but Exists:**  \n  A few parks and modern developments experiment with color or geometry (black, green, brown, modern shapes, or lanterns), but these are exceptions.\n- **Bridge/Arterial Lighting is Distinct:**  \n  These environments use taller, more specialized poles with minimalist right-angled lamps, signaling infrastructural adaptation to wider spaces/vehicular needs.\n- **Pedestrian/Wayside Lighting is Purpose-built:**  \n  Bollard and lantern types serve walkers, favoring ambiance/safety without impacting driver visibility.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Summary**\n\n**Adachi’s street lamps are predominantly utilitarian and mounted on multi-purpose utility poles, with a palette of grey or metallic finishes, minimalist shapes, and no ornamentation.**  \n- The typical lamp is either an elongated oval, rectangular, or cylindrical head fixed to a concrete or galvanized steel pole, often accompanied by electrical/telecom wires.\n- On highways and bridges, dedicated tall steel poles with rectangular lamps and an industrial look provide wide-area lighting.\n- Parks and walkways feature short, black bollard-style lamps; the rare pocket park or landscaped zone may have decorative, lantern-style, bronze/brown lamps for atmosphere.\n- Some residential poles may be painted pale green or black to suit the local aesthetic, but this is unusual.\n- In a minority of cases, utility poles lack street lamps altogether, particularly on very small or low-traffic streets.\n\n**Decorative or historical stylings are exceedingly rare, and the design ethos is firmly rooted in practicality, cost-efficiency, and the seamless integration of lighting with existing utility infrastructure.**  \n**Variation primarily serves functional adaptation—be it for traffic, pedestrian safety, or ambience in green spaces—but the overall visual language remains understated and modern.**"

    "lamp_info": "I will analyze the provided observations on street lamps in Shinagawa, Tokyo, systematically cross-referencing the details to identify all distinct lamp patterns. I’ll focus on recurring characteristics (color, shape, mounting, style, features, and placement) and organize the various types into clear groups. I will not omit any key feature or lamp variety as instructed.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: **Extracting Distinct Observed Features**\n\n**1. Color & Finish**\n- Predominantly neutral/utilitarian: metallic gray, silver, dull bronze/brown, matte black/dark gray, pastel green, light gray/off-white, rarely pastel green.  \n- Color on decorative/traditional types: matte black with some ornamentation.\n\n**2. Pole Shape**\n- Almost always: cylindrical, slender, straight (occasionally gently tapered).\n- Sometimes: curve outward at the top (especially for street/road lamps).\n- Rarely: T-shaped or Y-shaped arms at top.\n\n**3. Lamp Head/Fixture**\n- Modern/utilitarian types:  \n  - Flat disc/saucer-shaped lamp heads.\n  - Compact, horizontally mounted rectangular/oval fixtures (often for LED).\n  - \"Cobra-head\" or semi-oval designs.\n  - Spherical globes in rare cases (twin globes in some residential/commercial streets).\n- Ornamental types:  \n  - Vertically elongated, multi-faceted/octagonal lanterns with pointed finials.\n\n**4. Mounting**\n- On dedicated metal poles.\n- Mounted on concrete utility poles (via metal arm/bracket).\n- Arms mostly straight, sometimes gently arched or subtly curved.\n- On medians for highways, sidewalk for residential/urban use, attached to utility poles in backstreets or older areas.\n\n**5. Style**\n- Vast majority: modern, minimalist, utilitarian, explicitly lacking ornamentation.\n- Functional, no banners (except some lamp posts with banners in traditional/ornamental styles), little to no embellishment.\n- Decorative elements only on specific “neo-traditional” models: subtle bands, finials, banners.\n\n**6. Light Source & Output**\n- Modern lamps: mostly LED or equivalent clear, white light; some older sodium lamps emit yellowish-white.\n- Spherical/frosted globes give soft diffuse light (rare pattern).\n- Downward directed light in almost all fixtures.\n\n**7. Additional Features**\n- Street/directory sign holder below globes in some.\n- Some serve as mounts for sensors/cameras (rare, seen in modern lamp posts in newly developed areas).\n- Occasional street banners (mainly with neo-traditional/ornamental posts).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: **Formulating Distinct Groups/Patterns**\n\nBased on recurring features and unique variants, lamps in Shinagawa can be grouped as follows:\n\n---\n\n#### **Group 1: Modern, Utilitarian Metal Pole with Minimalist Head**\n\n**Key Features**\n- **Color:** Metallic gray, silver, or dull black (sometimes dull brown/bronze in industrial zones), less often light green.\n- **Pole:** Tall, cylindrical, straight; may have gentle curve at the top for arms or lamp head.\n- **Head/Fixture:**  \n  - Flat, disc/saucer or slim rectangular LED; sometimes oval/cobra-head style.\n  - Heads mounted directly on top or on a horizontal/curved arm.\n  - Usually single fixture per pole, but dual (T/Y-arm) on some medians/highways for broad coverage.\n- **Mounting:**  \n  - Standalone pole or on concrete utility pole (via arm) in backstreets.\n  - Arched or horizontal arm extending lamp head over the road or sidewalk.\n- **Style:** Completely functional, no decoration. No finials, bands, or additional features except possibly sensor/camera mounts on some modern posts.\n- **Placement:** Medians (wide roads/highways), sidewalks (urban streets), alleys (on utility poles).\n- **Light:** Bright white (LED/metal halide); in some cases, warm/yellowish (sodium lamp).\n- **Other:** Sometimes sign plates underneath fixtures (especially on residential/commercial versions).\n\n**Example Subtypes in this Group:**\n- Highway/arterial: very tall, flat disc-head directly on pole or on T/Y-arms, metallic gray or bronze finish.\n- City/residential: mid-height, straight or gently curved arm with disc or rectangular fixture, gray/black/green pole, sometimes small sign panel.\n- Alleys/backstreets: lamps mounted on utility (concrete) poles, horizontal arm with “cobra-head” or shallow dome fixture.\n\n---\n\n#### **Group 2: Twin Globe “Urban Modern” Lamps (Residential/Commercial Zones)**\n\n**Key Features**\n- **Color:** Matte dark gray/metallic.\n- **Pole:** Cylindrical, slender, straight; moderate height.\n- **Fixture:** Two spherical, frosted/opaque white globes on short horizontal arms at top, extending in opposite directions from central arch.\n- **Mounting:** Standalone, on pole by sidewalk/frontage.\n- **Style:** Sleek, modern, functional with a subtle design element (twin globes offer a slightly more urban aesthetic).\n- **Additional Feature:** Directory/information sign below fixtures.\n- **Placement:** Residential/commercial mixed-use areas.\n\n---\n\n#### **Group 3: Neo-Traditional/Ornamental Street Lamps**\n\n**Key Features**\n- **Color:** Matte black or very dark gray.\n- **Pole:** Tall, cylindrical, some decorative bands/moldings at base/midsection.\n- **Fixture:** Single, vertical, elongated, octagonal/multifaceted lantern with pointed finial.\n- **Mounting:** Lantern set directly atop pole.\n- **Style:** Neo-traditional, evokes Japanese historic design but built with modern powder-coated metal.\n- **Additional Feature:** Occasional attached street banner; sometimes small, horizontal secondary lamp or sign light below the main fixture.\n- **Placement:** Selected neighborhood center/cultural streets.\n\n---\n\n#### **Group 4: Pastel Green Double/Y-Armed Functional Lamps**\n\n**Key Features**\n- **Color:** Pastel green (pale green).\n- **Pole:** Tall, cylindrical, Y-shaped arm at top.\n- **Fixture:** Two boxy, rectangular lamp heads, slight greenish tint to housing.\n- **Style:** Minimal, utilitarian—mid to late 20th-century vintage but not ornate.\n- **Additional Feature:** Small street sign below lamps.\n- **Placement:** Older residential neighborhoods.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: **Note on Rarer Configurations & Integration**\n\n- Some lamps serve dual functions (lighting and mounting for cameras/sensors) especially in modern installations.\n- Some lamps (especially on medians) use T/Y configurations for double-sided coverage.\n- Lamp heads are generally downward directed and shielded for urban efficacy and night-sky preservation.\n- Integration with other urban infrastructure is common: mounting on shared utility poles in alleys, presence among overhead wiring, etc.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary Table**\n\n| Group | Pole Color/Material    | Shape (Pole/Head)                | Fixture Type/Head         | Mounting                  | Style        | Placement/Area                 | Notable Details                     |\n|-------|-----------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| 1     | Gray/Silver/Black/Bronze/Green | Cylindrical, tall/straight/curve | Flat disc, rectangular, oval, cobra-head | Standalone/utility pole/median | Minimal, utilitarian | Streets, highways, alleys           | LEDs or sodium, some with arm/curve |\n| 2     | Dark gray/metallic    | Cylindrical, moderate height      | Twin spherical white globes| Standalone                | Modern, functional| Mixed-use residential/commercial | Small sign panel below heads         |\n| 3     | Black, dark gray      | Cylindrical, bands/finial         | Tall octagonal lantern    | Standalone                | Neo-traditional | Cultural/neighborhood centers     | Banners, subtle decorative details  |\n| 4     | Pastel/pale green     | Cylindrical, Y-shaped arm         | Two boxy rectangular      | Standalone                | Utilitarian/vintage| Older residential              | Street sign plate, green tint        |\n\n---\n\n## **Final Summary: Distinct Patterns of Street Lamps in Shinagawa Ward, Tokyo**\n\nShinagawa’s street lamps are predominantly **modern, minimalist, and functional**, with considerable variety matching street typology and context.\n\n**1. The largest group** is the **utilitarian modern pole**, almost always metallic gray/silver/bronze or black, featuring slim, cylindrical shapes and flat or rectangular lamp heads (LED or similar), sometimes with “cobra-head” styles in alleys, and dual T/Y arms for wide roads or medians. Lamps are typically devoid of ornament and emphasize efficiency and unobtrusive integration into infrastructure. Many in alleys are mounted onto concrete utility poles.\n\n**2. In mixed-use residential and commercial areas**, a distinct subtype features **twin spherical white globes** on horizontal arms at the top of matte gray posts, sometimes with a small sign below—more visually distinct but still modern and not ornate.\n\n**3. A unique presence in select neighborhoods is the **neo-traditional style**: matte black posts with gentle decorative bands and classic, vertically elongated lantern heads bearing pointed finials, often adorned with street banners or secondary sign lights—evoking historic Tokyo while using modern materials.\n\n**4. In some older residential streets**, you’ll find **pale green, Y-armed poles with twin boxy lamps**—a utilitarian but slightly vintage aesthetic, sometimes with green sign plates beneath.\n\n**While the overwhelming theme is minimalist utility—function and unobtrusive design—there are neighborhoods and uses (e.g., cultural street, commercial frontages) where subtle styling or tradition is introduced, but always within a practical, contemporary build.**\n\n**Street lamp fixtures in Shinagawa thus fall into four primary groups:**\n- (1) Modern utilitarian (sole or dual arms, discs/rectangular/oval/cobra-heads, metallic/bronze/black/green, on poles or utility posts);\n- (2) Twin globe modern types (rare but distinctive in residential/mixed-use);\n- (3) Neo-traditional lantern style (black, ornate, neighborhood-specific);\n- (4) Pastel green double-lamp vintage utilitarian (in select residential areas).\n\n**No elaborate historical, vintage cast-iron, or flamboyantly decorative street lamps are present; all styles prioritize illumination, maintainability, and context-appropriate visual impact.**\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**\n> **Shinagawa’s street lamps reflect Tokyo’s pragmatic urban design—sleek, neutral-colored, mostly metallic poles with minimalist modern lamp heads are everywhere, with select areas showing slight stylistic variation (twin globes, pastel green, or neo-traditional lanterns). Nearly all are purposely devoid of unnecessary decoration, supporting a safe, efficient, and harmonious streetscape.**"

Pole and Arm Shape**\n- Nearly all are **slender, cylindrical, straight** poles; some slightly tapered at top.\n- Most poles feature an **outward-curving or “shepherd’s crook”/L-shaped arm**—the arm typically curves up, then out, supporting the lamp.\n- Variants: some have a straight horizontal arm with no or less curve, sometimes directly projecting perpendicularly.\n\n**C. Mounting and Arrangement**\n- Usually **pole-mounted** on pedestrian sidewalks, often integrated with utility poles (sometimes solely for lighting, sometimes also for wires, signs, or utility boxes).\n- Lamps are placed at regular intervals.\n\n**D. Lamp Head/Fixture Shape**\n- Several types:\n    1. **Oval/oblong/dome-shaped** (slight dome, semi-globe, aerodynamic, or teardrop forms)\n    2. **Compact, boxy, or rectangular** (often called cube- or box-style; sometimes slightly rounded or with flat undersides)\n    3. **Round/semi-globe** (smaller domes, frosted or translucent for light diffusion)\n    4. **Minimalist, slightly upturned or rounded fixture**\n- Usually mounted *horizontally*, angled slightly downward; unornamented.\n\n**E. Lamp Head Materials & Technology**\n- Most are described as **LED or sodium vapor fixtures** (inferred from shape/cover); *translucent coves/diffusion covers* mentioned.\n\n**F. Style & Ornamentation**\n- Overwhelmingly **utilitarian, minimalist, and functional**.\n- NO **retro/historic ornaments, color accents, banding, historical lantern forms, or engravings**.\n- Occasionally, a street sign or utility box is attached for functional reasons.\n- Some rare colored poles (blue or brown) appear, mainly in redevelopment or differentiated areas.\n\n**G. Other Features**\n- **No secondary equipment:** rare or never see banners, flower baskets, cameras.\n- Some lamp posts also act as utility poles with power/communication wires.\n- Placement is consistently for maximum illumination, often at crosswalks, street corners, and roadways.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Identifying Distinct Lamp Groups in Kita Ward\n\n### **Group A: Standard Metallic/Gray Municipal Lamps**\n- **Color:** Light/dark metallic gray (unpainted or painted steel/aluminum)\n- **Pole:** Slender, cylindrical, straight; sometimes with a slight outward curve at the top or just a horizontal extension\n- **Arm/Fixture:** Outward-curving “shepherd’s crook” or straight horizontal arm, unornamented\n- **Lamp Head:** Compact, boxy or oval/oblong/dome-like, oriented downward\n- **Style:** Purely functional, modern/minimalist, no decorations\n- **Mounting:** Commonly pole-only, but sometimes sharing with utility equipment\n- **Location:** Most common on residential roads, alleys, and standard streets throughout Kita\n\n### **Group B: Curved Arm, Compact Lamp Head (Brown, Blue, or Black Variants)**\n- **Color:** Painted brown/black OR bluish steel (possibly area- or redevelopment-specific)\n- **Pole:** Straight, slender, more often single-use (lighting only), rarely multipurpose\n- **Arm:** Gently curved arm extending out and upward, with fixture at end\n- **Lamp Head:** Small, rounded, minimalist (aerodynamic, modern teardrop, or rounded rectangle form)\n- **Style:** Contemporary, blends in with new urban infrastructure, maintains minimal/functional focus—*no ornamentation*\n- **Mounting:** Often on their own poles; sometimes integrated with visible colored bases or matching lamp head color\n\n### **Group C: Hybrid Utility Poles with Attached Lighting**\n- **Color:** Matching metallic gray (galvanized finish), occasional beige band\n- **Pole:** Utility multipurpose pole (carries wires, signs, sometimes lamps)\n- **Lamp Fixture:** Short horizontal or slightly angled arm, with compact rectangular or boxy lamp (rarely, a rounded polycarbonate cover)\n- **Lamp Head:** Functional, unobtrusive, designed more for integration than standalone impact\n- **Style:** As strictly functional as possible, prioritizing mounting flexibility over uniform design\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Nuanced Differences and Special Mentions\n\n- **Color variation** exists but is minor (gray dominates; brown, black, and blue exist in specific locales/streets).\n- **Lamp head differences**: Most are minimal, but heads may be oval, dome, rectangular, or cube-like—usually determined by era or bulb technology.\n- **Utility integration:** Some lamp posts exist entirely for lighting; others double as carriers for wires, street signs, or control boxes.\n- **No historical or decorative styles** are present in any observation (rules out retro, ornate, or colorful community lamps).\n- **Distinct lack of community or art features:** No banners, baskets, or themed elements.\n\n---\n\n## FINAL SUMMARY OF STREET LAMP CHARACTER IN KITA WARD\n\n### **Summary Table: Lamp Types and Their Features**\n\n| Group  | Color                       | Pole/Arm               | Lamp Head          | Style             | Mounting/Usage              | Decoration                   |\n|--------|-----------------------------|------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|\n|  A     | Light/dark metallic gray    | Slim, cylindrical; straight or curved arm (“crook” or L-shape) | Compact: boxy, oval, dome, teardrop | Utilitarian, modern, minimalist | Street lighting (sometimes integrated with utility poles) | None                         |\n|  B     | Brown, black, or blue (area-specific) | Slender, straight; gently curved arm | Small, minimalist, rounded, aerodynamic | Modern/contemporary, unobtrusive | Standalone, newer developments | None                         |\n|  C     | Metallic gray, w/ beige band | Utility pole with attached lamp | Rectangular or box head, polycarbonate cover | Purely functional              | Shared with wires, boxes, signage             | None        |\n\n### **Key Features in All Types:**\n- **Consistency:** Gray/silver metallic poles dominate, but browns/blues appear in select settings.\n- **Pole shape:** Always slim/cylindrical; the arm may curve slightly or be straight.\n- **Lamp heads:** Boxy/rectangular or compact oval/dome, always facing down, never ornamental.\n- **Function over form:** No decorative elements, paint accents, banners, or vintage stylings.\n- **Integration:** Many lamps double as utility structures; some are single-purpose.\n- **Maintained and unobtrusive:** All lamps are described as clean, in working order, and blending quietly into the urban landscape.\n\n---\n\n## **CONCISE WARD SUMMARY**\n\n**Kita Ward's street lamps are uniformly modern, utilitarian, and unobtrusive. Most use slender, metallic poles (light or dark grey) with simple outward-curving or straight arms. Lamp heads are compact, boxy, oval, or dome-shaped, always minimalist, facing downward, and unadorned. A minority of lamps use poles painted brown, black, or blue (mostly in redeveloped or special areas); utility integration is widespread. No decorative, artistic, or historic lamps are present—function and low-visual-impact define the district’s lighting. All lamps focus on efficient, consistent, and practical street illumination, tightly embedded in Kita Ward’s urban fabric.**"

Most commonly**—metallic grey or silver fixtures attached to existing concrete or metal utility poles alongside streets. These typically feature modern, minimalist, streamlined (oval or rectangular) lamp heads with no decorative features, and blend into the urban infrastructure. Their functional design prioritizes efficient, downward-facing lighting for both vehicles and pedestrians, and is typical for most residential and arterial roads.\n\n**2. Less commonly,** particularly in parks, landscaped public spaces, or wide boulevards, there are standalone lamp posts in dark brown/bronze (sometimes light grey), with sleek cylindrical poles and minimalist box-like lamp fixtures. These are also utilitarian in style but sometimes chosen to blend more harmoniously with greenery.\n\n**3. Along gardens, paths, or pedestrian areas**, short bollard-style lamps (black or dark grey, cylindrical) are used to provide low-level illumination for walkways and landscaped beds. These do not serve road lighting and are designed for subtle path or accent lighting.\n\n**Overall,** Nerima’s street lighting emphasizes modernity, unobtrusiveness, and functional efficiency, with virtually no use of decorative or historic lamp styles. The integration of street lamps into utility infrastructure (utility poles) is a key hallmark, as is the lack of distinct ornamentation or color contrast. Bollard-style lights serve only pedestrian areas and do not appear in road settings.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion (Per Your Task):**\n\n**In Nerima, Tokyo, municipal street lamps are almost universally utilitarian, modern, and unadorned, falling into three main types: utility pole-mounted streamlined fixtures (most common), standalone minimalist posts (less common and often brown/bronze), and short bollard/pedestrian path luminaires (for gardens/walkways only). Key distinguishing features are mounting style, color (grey/silver or brown/bronze for standalone), and lamp head shape (streamlined/rectangular), with all designed for efficient, downward illumination while blending unobtrusively with the cityscape and infrastructure.**\n\n---\n\n**If you need a diagram or categorized bullet points for a reference guide, let me know!**"

hexagonal or polygonal, frosted glass/acrylic, pointed caps/top finials, geometric frames.\n- **Color/Finish:** Black or dark brown.\n- **Style:** Fusion of classic/traditional lantern form with modern construction/materials.\n- **Application:** Quieter neighborhood main streets, traditional shopping approaches, “retro-modern” streetscapes.\n- **No ornate filigree; understated but more visually notable than pure utilitarian types.**\n\n---\n\n## 8. **Pedestrian Pathway Lamps with Disc/Cylinder Heads**\n\n### Features:\n- **Mounting:** Standalone slender pole, metallic/silver finish.\n- **Lamp Head:** Short cylinder or disc, sits directly atop post, flat-topped or gently domed.\n- **Height:** Lower, pedestrian scale.\n- **Style:** Ultra-minimal, mostly for footpaths/gardens/parklets.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Patterns, Commonalities, Distinct Groupings**\n\n- The **majority** of regular Setagaya residential streets, lanes, and secondary roads use **utility-pole mounted, minimalist/rectangular/capsule LED or fluorescent lamps** of pale gray/silver or (occasionally) muted green.\n- On **broader roads or recently resurfaced streets**, tall standalone dark pole lamps with streamlined lamp heads (rectangular, oval, disc) predominate.\n- **Older/retro-esque shopping and pedestrian areas** feature **dark green, maroon, or black lantern-style, double-headed, or globe-accented lamps** with polygonal/hexagonal heads and some retro styling.\n- **Wall-mounted building lights** are used for hyper-local residential lighting (entryways, walk-and-stair security).\n- **Pathways/gardens** often use smaller, hyper-minimal disc/cylinder head posts for discreet lighting.\n\n---\n\n# Master Summary: Street Lamp Types & Patterns in Setagaya, Tokyo\n\n**Setagaya’s street lighting exhibits a clear stratification by location and function:** \n\n---\n\n## **1. Utility Pole-Mounted Minimalist Lamps**\n- **MOST COMMON** on residential byroads and neighborhood lanes.\n- **Features:** Gray concrete utility poles, simple straight metal arms, compact *rectangular, oval, or capsule-shaped* heads, painted in *gray/silver/off-white (occasionally green)*.\n- **Style:** Purely utilitarian and functional. No decoration. Often amidst overhead wires.\n- **Height:** Typically above head height, enabling coverage of both roadway and sidewalk.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Standalone Minimalist Modern Poles**\n- **Prominent on main roads, some medians, sidewalks, or park paths.**\n- **Features:** Tall, dark*gray/black* or metallic*silver* slim poles; *curved or angular arms;* lamp heads are small, *rectangular, boxy, oval, teardrop, disc or short cylinder*.\n- **Style:** Ultra-minimal; no ornamentation.\n- **Function:** Efficient, even illumination along wider streets.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Retro-Style Lanterns for Shopping Streets/Neighborhood Centers**\n- **Often double-headed, polygonal (hex/octa) lantern heads.**\n- **Poles:** Dark green, maroon, black, or brown—slim with upward curved arms, sometimes with archways.\n- **Lamp Heads:** Frosted/translucent glass or acrylic; subtle retro/vintage elements (finials, caps).\n- **Function:** Both illumination and neighborhood visual identity.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Decorative Archway Globe Assemblies**\n- **Key feature of shopping street entrances (“shotengai”).**\n- **Arch/Truss:** Maroon or wine-red thick posts/arch, with multiple *suspended spherical (opal) lamps* for ambient and decorative lighting.\n- **Function:** Create inviting entry points and signal shopping/commercial areas.\n\n---\n\n## **5. Wall-Mounted Security/Utility Lamps**\n- **Usage:** Directly attached to residential or shop building exteriors.\n- **Feature:** Small, semi-cylindrical or cylindrical metallic or beige/white sconces, ridged or smooth diffusers, always downward.\n- **Purpose:** Hyper-local entry/stair/path lighting.\n\n---\n\n## **6. Modern-Classical Hybrid Lantern Posts**\n- **Found on select neighborhood streets/borders of residential/shopping zones.**\n- **Feature:** Twin lamps per pole; lantern heads are polygonal (hex/oct), framed, symmetrical, with subtle retro references.\n- **Poles:** Black/dark brown, gently curved arms, classic-modern blend.\n\n---\n\n## **7. Low-Profile Pedestrian Pathway Lamps**\n- **Use:** Garden paths, parks, small pedestrian walkways.\n- **Feature:** Short, slender metallic posts, minimal disc/cylinder head, silver/gray, non-decorative, low to the ground.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Overall Themes:**\n- **Dominant overall aesthetic:** Functional minimalism for all general infrastructure; form follows function.\n- **Color palette:** Grays and silvers (utility poles, fixtures), dark neutrals (modern posts), muted greens (some legacy models), and deeper tones for decorative/retro zones.\n- **Ornamentation:** Strictly limited to commercial/retro-pedestrian areas; standard residential areas are completely utilitarian.\n- **Mounting context:** Integration with above-ground utility poles is the default; *standalone* posts are exceptional rather than rule, unless in re-developed, commercial, or pedestrian-priority settings.\n- **Material:** Concrete (utility poles), painted/powder-coated steel or aluminum (posts and fixtures), frosted/acrylic glass for lantern heads.\n- **Light technology:** Modernized towards LED or compact fluorescent, especially in newer/recently maintained fixtures.\n- **Distinct decorative/identity features:** Shopping streets (“shotengai”) rely on retro or visually prominent lamps and arches as a branding element; these are excluded from standard lanes.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Groupings (Reference):**\n\n1. **Utility-pole (concrete) mounted, rectangular/oval capsule-shaped, silver/gray/green minimalist lamps.**\n2. **Standalone, dark or silver contemporary metal poles with curved or angular arms, streamlined modern lamp heads.**\n3. **Dark green, double-head, polygonal retro (lantern-style) poles for shopping/retro areas.**\n4. **Maroon archways with globe lamps and signage for shotengai entrances.**\n5. **Wall-mounted mini sconces or domes on building exteriors (not true “street lamps” per se).**\n6. **Black/dark brown, modern-classic hex lantern twin-head posts (transitional/neighborhood center areas).**\n7. **Miniature, disc/cylinder head, pedestrian pathway posts in parks/allotments/community gardens.**\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table**\n\n| Group                                 | Mounting           | Pole Color        | Lamp Head Shape/Color             | Style                        | Typical Use/Location            |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Utility-pole Minimal                   | Utility pole       | Gray/concrete/green| Rectangular, capsule/oval, green/silver/gray | Pure utilitarian, no decor  | Most residential streets        |\n| Standalone Minimal                     | Post, sidewalk     | Gray, black, silver| Small oval, teardrop, box, disc, cylinder | Modern/minimal, no decor   | Broader/main roads, walkways    |\n| Retro Lantern Shopping                  | Lamp post/sidewalk | Dark green/maroon  | Polygonal lantern, frosted glass, finials   | Retro/modern classic hybrid | Shopping/pedestrian streets     |\n| Archway Globe Shopping                  | Archway            | Maroon/Wine Red    | Hanging globe(s), opal white                 | Decorative/shopping         | Shotengai entrances             |\n| Wall-mounted Security                   | Building wall      | Silver/beige/white | Half-cylinder, dome, sconce                   | Hyper-utilitarian           | Entryways, walkways, stairs     |\n| Black/Brown Hex Lantern Twin           | Post, sidewalk     | Black/dark brown   | Twin hex lantern, geometric, frosted panel    | Modern with retro elements  | Residential/shopping transition |\n| Pedestrian Disc/Cylinder                | Post, ground       | Silver/gray        | Disc or short cylinder, flat/domed            | Minimal, path-scale         | Paths, parks, gardens           |\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\n**Setagaya’s street lighting is dominated by functional, minimal, and neutral-colored lamps mounted on utility poles, with modern, standalone posts present along major roads and footpaths. Distinctive retro or decorative lamps mark shopping streets and neighborhood centers, while wall-mounted lights and pathway posts provide solutions for entryways and narrow walkways. Every lamp group adheres either to a pragmatic, infrastructure-first style, or—on commercial stretches—to a subtle retro-inspired design that supports neighborhood identity and navigation.**"

    "lamp_info": "Let's break down the process and systematically organize the **street lamp observations for the Taito ward of Tokyo**, locating all distinct patterns and features as described.\n\n---\n\n## **First, extract and cross-reference the information:**\n\n### **Observation 1:**\n- **Type & Mount:** Lamp fixed to standard grey concrete utility poles (not standalone posts); horizontal straight metal arm.\n- **Lamp Head:** Rectangular/square box, functional look, metal/plastic, angled towards street.\n- **Color:** Neutral grey (pole/arm), lamp housing dark (black/dark grey).\n- **Style:** Purely utilitarian/modern, no decorations.\n- **Quantity/Spacing:** Nearly every pole, well-distributed lighting.\n- **Other:** Overhead wires visible, no banners or signs.\n\n---\n\n### **Observation 2:**\n- **Type:** Minimalist modern pole lamp.\n- **Pole:** Straight cylindrical, slender, painted matte black or dark brown.\n- **Arm:** Right-angled horizontal extension.\n- **Lamp Fixture:** Compact box/rectangular, flush with arm.\n- **Height:** Medium (3–4 meters).\n- **Placement:** Sidewalk, regular intervals.\n- **Distinct:** Strictly utilitarian, no ornament.\n- **Lighting:** Downward/flat, for pedestrian area.\n\n---\n\n### **Observation 3:**\n- **Pole:** Cylindrical, smooth metal, likely steel/aluminum, light grey/silver.\n- **Arm:** Smooth curve (almost 90° arc), projects outward.\n- **Lamp Head:** Oval/elliptical, horizontal, flat, unobtrusive; likely LED or sodium vapor.\n- **Height:** 7–9 meters (taller than previous).\n- **Style:** Modern utilitarian/minimalist.\n- **Material:** Likely galvanized steel/aluminum.\n- **No decoration or color flash.**\n\n---\n\n### **Observation 4:**\n- **Pole:** Pale green, cylindrical, smooth, metal (steel or aluminum).\n- **Style:** Functional/municipal, no decoration.\n- **Placement:** Set into sidewalk near modest green safety fence.\n- **Features:** Only a sticker/placard (maintenance/address); no visible lamp head (image angle issue).\n\n---\n\n### **Observation 5:**\n- **Pole:** Medium grey, metallic, matte finish (anti-corrosion or galvanization).\n- **Shape:** Tall, slender, cylindrical.\n- **Style:** Modern, functional; merges with utility lines (dual use).\n- **Fixture:** Compact LED extending horizontally, short arm.\n- **No ornament or branding.**\n- **Condition:** New, well-maintained.\n\n---\n\n### **Observation 6:**\n- **Fixture:** Small, wall-mounted, attached to building (not a pole).\n- **Arm:** Short, metallic (stainless/aluminum).\n- **Lamp Head:** Compact, round, frosted/matte glass diffuser.\n- **Color:** Metallic gray.\n- **Placement:** Close to wall, above shop entrance.\n- **Style:** Modern utilitarian, no decoration.\n- **Usage:** Shopfront/commercial entry, not general street lighting.\n\n---\n\n## **Now, organize the observed lamps into distinct GROUPS, summarized by common patterns:**\n\n---\n\n### **GROUP 1: Pole-Mounted Utility/Functional Lamps (\"Infrastructure-Integrated\")**\n- **Mounting:** Fixed to existing concrete or metal utility poles (not freestanding posts).\n- **Arm:** Horizontal or short-projection metal arm.\n- **Color:** Neutral (grey, metallic grey/dark grey, sometimes pale green).\n- **Lamp Head Shape:** Boxy/rectangular (sometimes hard to distinguish due to image angle), dark colored.\n- **Features:** No ornamentation, no banners/signage; all wiring overhead. Entire focus on function, not appearance.\n- **Lighting:** Oriented down/angled to street for broad coverage.\n- **Distribution:** Nearly every pole, ensuring even spread.\n- **Examples:** \n  - Grey concrete pole with boxy lamp (Observation 1 & 5).\n  - Utility pole with horizontally projecting lamp.\n\n---\n\n### **GROUP 2: Freestanding Modern Minimalist Street Lamps (Sidewalk/Walkway Focus)**\n- **Pole:** Straight, slender, cylindrical; heights vary (3–4 m for pedestrian, 7–9 m for full street).\n- **Color:** Matte black, dark brown, pale green, light grey/silver.\n- **Arm:** Minimalist right-angled or smooth curved arm projecting out from pole.\n- **Lamp Head:** Compact, usually rectangular/boxy OR oval/elliptical (latest models).\n- **Style:** Strict minimalism, no ornamentation of any kind.\n- **Material:** Steel or aluminum; sometimes painted, sometimes natural/galvanized.\n- **Placement:** Sidewalk or near curb, regular intervals.\n- **Lighting Direction:** Directed downward/flat for walkway/street illumination.\n- **Examples:**\n  - Slender matte black with box fixture (Observation 2).\n  - Tall silver pole with gentle curved arm and oval lamp (Observation 3).\n  - Pale green straightforward pole (Observation 4; lamp head not visible, but same basic pattern).\n\n---\n\n### **GROUP 3: Wall-Mounted Entry/Shopfront Lamps**\n- **Mounting:** Affixed directly to building façade (commercial).\n- **Shape:** Short arm, round lamp head with frosted/matte glass diffuser, metallic gray parts.\n- **Purpose:** Localized, focused illumination for entrances—not street-wide lighting.\n- **Style:** Modern, utilitarian, no ornamentation.\n- **Placement:** Above commercial doors or shopfronts in alleys and business districts.\n- **Example:** Observation 6.\n\n---\n\n## **Distinct Information/Patterns Identified**\n- **COLORS:** Neutral, subdued palette (grey, metallic, pale green, matte black/dark brown).\n- **SHAPES:** Almost all cylindrical pole; lamp heads vary: rectangular/box (older/utility style), oval/elliptical (modern main roads), or round (wall-mounted).\n- **STYLE:** Extreme utilitarian modern—almost never decorative or historic.\n- **MOUNTING:** Multiple types: utility-pole-mounted; dedicated sidewalk posts; wall-mounted for entries.\n- **MATERIALS:** Metal (mostly steel or aluminum), sometimes painted for anti-corrosion, sometimes left metallic.\n- **DECOR/ACCENTS:** Nearly none; sometimes just a sticker for maintenance/address.\n- **INFRASTRUCTURE:** Many lamps share poles with utility lines—dual-use poles dominate smaller streets.\n- **HEIGHT/PLACEMENT:** Lower installations (3–4 m) for walkways, taller (7–9 m) for street/road coverage.\n- **CONDITION:** Typically well-maintained, clean, untagged.\n\n---\n\n## **FINAL SUMMARY**\n\n### **Summary of Street Lamp Patterns in Taito Ward, Tokyo:**\n\n**1. Utility Pole-Mounted Lamps (Most Common):**\n- Street lighting is most frequently integrated with existing concrete or metal utility poles, using sober, functional horizontal arms to project boxy or rectangular fixtures (usually dark grey or black).\n- All infrastructure is visually utilitarian—no decorative features, no color accents, just practical designs for reliable coverage.\n- Wiring is usually overhead and visible, further emphasizing the focus on function.\n\n**2. Freestanding Modern Minimalist Lamps (Sidewalk/Street Posts):**\n- In newer developments or more prominent pedestrian areas, lighting may use standalone cylindrical steel/aluminum posts—pale green, light grey/silver, matte black, or dark brown.\n- These have minimalist arms—either right-angled or gently curved—supporting a compact, contemporary rectangular or oval/elliptical lamp head (often with LEDs).\n- Again, these are free of all embellishments, color, or municipal branding—designed to blend in and be visually unobtrusive.\n\n**3. Wall-Mounted Commercial/Entryway Lamps:**\n- For shopfronts and narrow alleys, small, modern wall-mounted lamps are common—with circular or disk-like glass diffusers on short metallic arms, prioritizing ultra-localized entry lighting.\n- These, too, are strictly modern in appearance—no traditional, lantern-like streetlights.\n\n**Key Features Across All Patterns:**\n- **Color:** Neutral/understated (grey, metallic, pale green, black/dark brown).\n- **Shape:** Cylindrical poles; lamp heads are boxy, oval, or round (for wall-mounted).\n- **Style:** Modern, purely utilitarian—almost never ornate or historic.\n- **Material:** Steel or aluminum (sometimes painted).\n- **Distribution:** Either at intervals on sidewalk/curb, or attached to virtually every utility pole, ensuring full coverage.\n- **No decorative banners, city branding, or traditional elements** are present in any observed pattern.\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nThe street lamps of Taito ward are characterized by their modern, efficient, and strictly utilitarian style, with three primary types:   \n1. **Utility-pole mounted functional lamps** (most common, especially side streets, and with overhead wiring);  \n2. **Freestanding minimalist posts** with rectangular or elliptical heads (some older, some newer, for main roads and walkways);  \n3. **Wall-mounted entryway/commercial fixtures** with small, round lamp heads.  \n\nThis clear focus on functionality, unobtrusiveness, and a neutral color palette defines the lighting design language for this Tokyo ward—no decorative or traditional \"Japanese lantern\" styles were observed."

Lamp heads are compact, aiming light downward, often dome, disc, or flat-box shaped.\n    - **Utility pole-mounted lamps** dominate side and residential streets. These feature short curved metal arms (grey, blue, or silver), supporting oval, rectangular, or older tube-style lamp heads. They are never decorated, blending in with utility clutter.\n    - **Columnar/monolith lamps** are found in newer redevelopments/public spaces, presenting as rectangular gray columns with integrated light panels.\n    - **Occasionally, unique municipal design**—notably the light blue, swan-neck curved lamps—coordinate with streetscape elements like railings.\n\n- **All lamps share:** function-focused, minimalist design, discreet color palette (grey, black, blue), single-head deployment, and avoidance of any decorative or retro motifs.\n\n- **Material:** Predominantly metal (steel/aluminum) for poles and heads; some use concrete utility poles or wooden telegraph poles.\n\n- **Lighting technology:** Modern installations likely LED; some older fixtures retain sodium/mercury vapor tubes.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nShinjuku’s street lighting comprises several distinct, utilitarian lamp designs, each adapted to its urban context. Variations occur in color (black, grey, blue), mounting (standalone vs. utility pole), and head shape (dome, disk, box, tube, column), but all avoid decorative elements—a testament to modern Tokyo's focus on efficient, unobtrusive urban infrastructure.\n\n---\n\n**If you wish to see this in chart or bullet-point listing per style, let me know!**"

    "lamp_info": "Let's carefully extract, cross-reference, and summarize all distinct patterns and features of street lamps in Suginami, Tokyo, as observed in your provided descriptions. I'll group the lamps by **physical characteristics, color, shape, placement/context, and style**, ensuring no variant is missed. Each detected lamp \"type\" is gathered and described, noting key distinguishing factors.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Modern, Utilitarian Lamp Poles (Predominant Style)**\n\n### **A. Basic Utility Pole-Mounted Lamps**\n- **Pole Color/Material:** Light gray, metallic, matte silver, or unpainted steel/aluminum; occasionally concrete utility poles (unpainted or light gray).\n- **Shape:** Slim, straight, cylindrical poles—sometimes the lamp is simply attached to an existing utility pole (concrete or metal), not a dedicated streetlight pole.\n- **Lamp Head:** \n  - **Shape:** Flat rectangular, trapezoidal, or square; sometimes oval/teardrop.\n  - **Mount:** Horizontal arm, sometimes with a gentle curve (“swan neck” or arched), projects from pole and affixes lamp fixture over the street.\n  - **Head Direction:** Downward-facing.\n  - **Head Finish:** Smooth, metallic or matte gray, sometimes translucent or frosted cover/diffuser.\n  - **Bulb Enclosure:** Flat or shallow domed, always minimalist.\n- **Height:** Moderate to tall (4–8 meters), positioned for optimal, widespread coverage.\n- **Style:** Strictly functional/utilitarian, modern, with no decorative elements—designed to blend with surroundings.\n- **Placement:** Along sidewalks, next to roads, in residential and suburban areas; lamps often attached to multi-use utility poles carrying wires/signage.\n- **Condition:** Clean, well-maintained; blend visually with other infrastructure.\n\n#### **Variants in This Group:**\n- Some lamps attached directly to utility (often concrete) poles via short, straight horizontal or arched metallic arms.\n- Lamp heads vary from:\n  - Flat rectangular/trapezoidal (box-like)\n  - Slightly rounded teardrop or oval heads\n  - Shallow round/dome heads (occasionally disc-like)\n- **Color Sub-Notes:** While most are metallic/silver/gray, a few are painted in light blue, faded blue, brown, or even dark green (depending on streetscape integration).\n\n---\n\n### **B. Dual-Headed and Special Mount Lamps**\n\n- **Design:** Vertical light pole (light color, usually white/off-white), with a gently arched horizontal crossbar at the top.\n- **Lamp Heads:** Two, small, compact, slightly flattened globes (not perfectly spherical).\n- **Lamp Cover:** Translucent amber/orange, giving warm light.\n- **Mounting Height:** Lower than typical city streetlights, just above ground-floor window level; well-suited for narrow residential streets.\n- **Style:** Purely functional, no decoration; sometimes with a small round sign beneath the lamp.\n- **Placement:** Very close to buildings/fences in tight alleys.\n- **Distinctive Feature:** Amber/orange “flattened globe” twin lights, dual-headed mount.\n\n---\n\n### **C. Modern, Conical or “Bell”-Shaped Twin Lamps**\n- **Pole:** Dark green, cylindrical metal pole.\n- **Fixtures:** Two lamps, each with white ribbed, bell/conical-shaped covers flaring outwards.\n- **Ornament:** Small (green) ball/ornament beneath one head, possibly street/neighborhood ID.\n- **Mounting:** Separate short arms projecting from the pole.\n- **Style:** Still modern/functional, but with the colored accent slightly referencing local shopping street identity.\n- **Placement:** Dense urban streetscapes, with signage and overhead wires.\n\n---\n\n## **2. Retro/Traditional-Style Lantern Street Lamps (Distinct Minority)**\n\n- **Pole:** Usually mounted on concrete utility poles (not free-standing), via projecting arm.\n- **Lamp Fixture:** Black or very dark gray; boxy, rectangular “lantern” with clear sides and peaked/tent top.\n- **Design Motif:** Reminiscent of Victorian/European or generalized “old-fashioned” streetlamps—rectilinear “lantern,” sometimes with ornamental support arms.\n- **Bulb/Light Source:** Usually down-facing, clear sides.\n- **Height:** Above head height but more neighborhood-scale.\n- **Placement:** Spaced along the street, especially in areas where neighborhood ambiance/walkability is emphasized.\n- **Distinctive Motif:** Only group with clear retro/historic cues; provides an inviting pedestrian environment; purely aesthetic choice for specific streets.\n- **Note:** No explicit Edo or Japanese historical motifs (i.e., not green “heritage” lamps, but generic retro lanterns).\n\n---\n\n## **3. Other Notable Variants / Special Details**\n\n- There were rare mentions of:\n  - Poles in white/off-white blending with surroundings (sometimes paired with the amber/orange dual globes above).\n  - Occasional use of brown or dark-painted poles, always with minimalist modern fixtures.\n  - Light blue-painted poles in quieter residential lanes, simplicity maintained in fixture design.\n- **Accessories/Attachments:** In almost all cases, focus is on functionality. Occasional presence of signage balls or neighborhood identification “ornaments” (not decorative but functional markers).\n\n---\n\n## **Summary Table of Street Lamp Types in Suginami Ward**\n\n| **Type**       | **Pole Color**  | **Lamp Head Shape**       | **Mount Style**       | **Distinct Features**                         | **Placement/Environment**         | **Decorative?**        |\n|----------------|-----------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------|\n| Basic Modern   | Gray/Metallic   | Rectangular, flat, boxy, oval/teardrop, shallow dome | Side/lateral arm on utility pole or own pole   | Clean, streamlined, minimal        | Streets, sidewalks, residential  | No                     |\n| Dual-Head Globe| White/off-white | 2x compact, flattened globes (amber/orange)          | Gently arched dual crossbar                   | Warm colored, Globe, low-mounted   | Tight alleys, near buildings      | No                     |\n| Conical/Bell   | Dark green      | 2x White ribbed conical/bell covers                  | Separate short arms on one pole               | Small green marker/ornament        | Shopping/residential streets      | Minor (color accent)    |\n| Retro Lantern  | Black/dark gray | Rectangular “lantern”, peaked top                    | Arm on concrete utility pole                  | Clear sides, neighborhood armature | Select “retro” street zones       | Yes (retro motif)       |\n| Brown/Blue Poles| Brown/Blue     | Modern minimalist, per above                         |                                 As above      | Blends w/ streetscape              | Quiet/mixed residential           | No                     |\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusions & Key Patterns**\n\n- The **overwhelming majority** of street lamps in Suginami are modern, functional, and minimalist: slim, metallic or muted-color poles with unadorned rectangular or teardrop/oval lamp heads, almost always utility-pole mounted or sharing space with wires/signage.\n- **Distinct exceptions** include:\n  - **Amber/Orange Globe Dual-Headed lamps:** low-set, white poles, only in narrow pedestrian contexts.\n  - **Retro Lanterns:** rectangular, black, peaked-top “lantern” heads on arms from utility poles; rare, used for ambiance in select areas.\n  - **Conical/Bell Cover Twin Lamps on Green poles:** are modern but slightly decorative on shopping/side streets, thanks to the color accent and distinctive luminaire shape.\n- **Color coordination:** Most lamps are metallic/gray or fit the area (occasional blue, brown, or green) for visual harmony.\n- **No Evidence:** of ornate historic Japanese, Victorian, or hyper-decorative styles outside the above-noted “retro” lanterns and colored accent poles.\n- **Functional focus:** No banners, flower baskets, or extra decorations—exceptions are minimal and generally utility-related (signs/small markers).\n\n---\n\n## **Comprehensive Summary**\n\nSuginami Ward’s street lighting is overwhelmingly practical, streamlined, and municipally standardized. Most street lamps are metal or concrete pole-mounted units with minimalist, geometrically simple lamp heads (rectangular, trapezoidal, rounded, or shallow domed), almost always in neutral colors like metallic gray, white, or blue, and frequently attached to shared utility poles. Variants with unique shapes or colors—including the dual amber/orange-globed, the dark green conical twin-head lamps, and occasional retro black “lantern” arms on neighborhood-focused blocks—offer contrast, used sparingly to create ambiance or highlight shopping streets. Decorative embellishments are absent except in occasional designated pedestrian/retail zones and with accessory color splashes (e.g., green sign balls, conical covers). Overall, Suginami’s lamps prioritize effectiveness, unobtrusiveness, and harmonization with dense residential and utility infrastructure."

The vast majority use slender, cylindrical metal poles, finished in neutral urban tones such as matte black, dark gray, metallic silver, or medium/dark brown. There are **three main functional groups**:\n\n1. **Modern Urban Black/Dark Grey Lamps:**  \n   - Found in main streets and business areas.\n   - Tall, slim poles; often curve at the top (gooseneck) or end in a right-angled horizontal arm.\n   - Small rectangular, flat, or boxy lamp heads, always downward-facing; no decorations.\n   - Occasionally combined with branded vertical signage.\n\n2. **Expressway/Infrastructure Metallic Lamps:**  \n   - Found on expressways, embankments, and major infrastructural corridors.\n   - Tall, slim, metallic silver or light gray poles, with minimally styled dome or boxy fixtures.\n   - No ornamentation, strictly utilitarian.\n\n3. **Bronze/Brown/Muted Pedestrian Lamps:**  \n   - Featured on overpasses, landscaped, or pedestrian-friendly streets.\n   - Brown, bronze, or muted tan shades, occasionally with curved or right-angled arms.\n   - Flat, oval/dome, or rectangular compact heads; fastidiously matched to the environment.\n   - Still minimalist, lacking any historical cues.\n\nAdditionally, at intersections, **utility/traffic signal poles** made of slender dark metal serve structural rather than classic street lighting roles, supporting signage and signals more than pedestrian illumination.\n\nAcross all types:\n- Lamp heads are compact, downward-oriented, integrated into the pole’s form.\n- There is a conspicuous absence of decorative, historical, vintage, or multi-branch lamps.\n- The palette and form are chosen to blend with contemporary urban architecture or landscape design.\n- Energy efficiency and modernity (often LED, sometimes inferred) are standard.\n\n**Absence:**  \nNo classic globe, lantern, ornate, or vintage lamps appear in Minato ward's typical municipal lighting arrangements. Some roads show no visible lamps, likely due to hidden installations or recent construction.\n\n---\n\n### **In short:**\nMinato's street lamps are grouped into (1) dark modern minimalist (for urban/commercial), (2) metallic utilitarian (for expressways and infrastructure), (3) brown/bronze contemporary functional (for bridges, landscaped streets), and (4) dark infrastructural poles for traffic lights/signs. All share a commitment to minimalism, a lack of ornament, and effective, environmentally integrated urban illumination."

    "lamp_info": "Let’s analyze and cross-reference all the provided observations for **street lamps in Itabashi ward, Tokyo**, extracting and grouping every *distinct* pattern, style, and feature:\n\n---\n\n## **Step 1: Collate and Compare Lamp Descriptions**\n\n### **A. Color & Material**\n\n- **Dark Green:** Found in pseudo-traditional \"lantern\" style lamps, often on commercial or shōtengai streets.\n- **Brown:** Utilitarian, modern, “J-shaped” street lamps lining roads/medians.\n- **Dark Brown/Black:** Boxy, rectangular fixtures, also modern utilitarian, no ornamentation.\n- **Matte Black or Dark Grey:** Double-headed square lanterns, mildly retro/deco but still modernized.\n- **Gray/Silver:** Most common for standard municipal/utility-integrated lamps. Both concrete (light/medium gray) and metal utility poles are cited.\n- **Light Gray/White:** Another utilitarian variant, especially steel or aluminum.\n\n### **B. Mounting/Integration**\n\n- **Municipal Utility Poles:** Nearly all lamps are **mounted to multi-purpose utility poles** (often supporting wiring, transformers, signs, etc.), not on standalone decorative lamp posts.\n- **Mount Type:** The majority are affixed by:\n  - **Straight horizontal arms** extending outward (most common)\n  - **J-shaped/gooseneck curve** for certain brown lamps\n  - **Cantilevered/side-mounted** for round/globe heads\n- **Heights:** Typically well above head height, often above rooftops or at 4–9 meters for wide street coverage.\n\n### **C. Lamp Head (Shape, Style, and Orientation)**\n\n- **Rectangular/Boxy:** Modern, functional lamps fixated to utility poles; unornamented, favoring LEDs or energy-efficient bulbs.\n- **Elongated Hexagonal/Pseudo-lantern:** Retro, dark green lamps, rarely ornamented, frosted panels.\n- **Oval/Elliptical/Capsule:** Streamlined heads (especially on modern brown or gray poles), horizontally oriented for efficient downlighting.\n- **Square Lanterns (Double-Headed):** Black/gray angular box lanterns attached in pairs to poles, evoking a retro or deco inspiration, but without extensive decoration.\n- **Round/Globe (Slightly Domed):** Side-mounted, found in some gray-pole settings—again, unfussy, more about function.\n\n### **D. Style & Ornamentation**\n\n- **Functional/Modern Utilitarian:** The overwhelming majority; little to no decorative features.\n- **Pseudo-traditional or Mildly \"Retro\":** Noted in certain green lanterns for shōtengai (commercial districts) and double-box lantern designs (mild deco cues), but these are minimal in detailing.\n- **No Historic or Iconic District Styling:** Except for a slight nod in green lanterns and deco-box types.\n\n### **E. Additional Features**\n\n- **Material:** Metal (often aluminum or steel), concrete poles, frosted or translucent plastic/glass for lenses.\n- **Wiring:** Most have external wiring, sometimes running visibly up the pole, especially on older installations.\n- **Multipurpose Poles:** Almost universal; poles also carry power, comm cables, and street/traffic signage.\n- **No Banners, Planters, or Cameras on Lamps:** Clean, infrastructure-focused.\n\n### **F. Placement & Distribution**\n\n- Lamps are evenly distributed for thorough coverage, serving both street and sidewalk.\n- Almost all images/descriptions indicate absence of pedestrian-scale, decorative, or freestanding lamp posts.\n\n---\n\n## **Step 2: Distinct Street Lamp Patterns/Groups in Itabashi**\n\n### **1.

Concrete Multi-Utility Poles (Older Residential Backstreets)**\n- Constructed from unpainted, light or medium gray concrete with a cylindrical, slightly textured style.\n- Support both lamp fixtures and overhead utility cables, emphasizing multipurpose infrastructure.\n- Lamp heads are small, box-shaped, and mounted on straight horizontal arms—purely functional, without ornamental features.\n- Typical of mid- to late-20th-century residential alleys, optimized for narrow, dense street conditions.\n\n### **2. Modern Metal, Slim Gooseneck Lamps (Urban/Suburban Streets)**\n- Tall, slim metal poles (steel/aluminum), cylindrical and painted in muted colors: dark gray, neutral gray, subtle blue-grey, and in some streets, a distinct light salmon/orangish-beige.\n- Each lamp features a smooth curved (“gooseneck” or “shepherd’s crook”) arm at the top, supporting a small, boxy or oval lamp head with a minimalist design—often rectangular and thin, sometimes subtly colored.\n- Style is resolutely modern and functional, designed to blend in and provide efficient LED (or similar) lighting with reduced visual clutter.\n- Sometimes support small placards or signage at eye level, but lack ornamentation, banners, or additional fixtures.\n- Deployed widely along both city sidewalks and residential areas, installed at regular street intervals.\n\n### **3. Double-Headed Metal Lamps for Major Expressways**\n- Slender metal poles, painted light gray or metallic silver, with a T-shaped top supporting two outwardly curved arms and oval lamp heads facing away from one another for maximum coverage.\n- Found in the medians of large roads, offering broad and balanced illumination for multiple lanes.\n- These too are devoid of decorative details, prioritizing a streamlined functional appearance.\n\n**Overall, Sumida’s street lamps are defined by solid, modern utilitarianism with minimal color or stylistic variation.** Most are unornamented, blend into the streetscape, and differ mainly in color/shape (depending on age, street type, or function). While most poles are gray or metallic, some districts add subtle hues (salmon, blue-grey) for minor distinction. There are no traditional, decorative, or historic lamps present in these observations. \n\n**All lamps—regardless of type—are designed for efficient urban lighting, minimal maintenance, and practical coexistence with the dense infrastructure of Tokyo.**"

Concrete/Green Utility-Mounted | Unpainted concrete or muted green metal | Shallow disc, minimalist, downward lamp, gooseneck or simple arm | Mounted on utility/concrete pole, amid trees, below utility wires | No ornamentation; sometimes blends with greenery; may hold signs/trash bags |\n| 4. Multi-Use Silver Poles        | Metallic silver/light gray metal | Flat, compact, rectangular box | Shared with traffic signs/signals   | Consolidated municipal infrastructure, space-efficient         |\n\n\n---\n\n## **Comprehensive Key Findings**\n\n1. **Color & Material Pattern:**  \n   - Dominance of muted, unobtrusive colors: dark brown, black, grays, metallic silvers, and muted green (the latter for blending with foliage).\n   - Materials primarily metal (steel/aluminium), but also unpainted concrete.\n\n2. **Lamp Head Variations:**  \n   - Cylindrical, rectangular/boxy, oblong/rounded, and globe shapes present.\n   - Diffuser covers (frosted, translucent, polycarbonate/acrylic) for softer light.\n   - No ornate or classical lantern heads; all are modern and streamlined.\n\n3. **Mounting & Functional Multiplicity:**  \n   - Attached directly to sidewalk as freestanding poles **or** mounted on utility/concrete poles (the latter sometimes carrying overhead lines, signage, trash bags).\n   - Sometimes integrated with traffic signals and regulatory signage.\n   - Gooseneck or right-angled arms are common for lamp projection; occasionally top-mounted, flush with pole.\n   - Regular presence of multi-purpose poles.\n\n4. **Style & Urban Integration:**  \n   - Across all types, a functional, minimalist, and unadorned approach prevails.\n   - Purpose: efficient, even illumination for roads and pedestrian sidewalks, maximum unobtrusiveness.\n   - No historic, decorative, or “old town” designs are in evidence—suggesting modernization and uniformity in municipal installations.\n\n5. **Distinct Groups/Patterns:**  \n   - **(1) Minimalist modern poles:** Round, black/gray/metallic, using compact lamps—sometimes doubling as utility or traffic support.\n   - **(2) Globe-style pedestrian lamps:** Light gray with sphere on top—standalone, for area/sidewalk lighting.\n   - **(3) Utility/concrete/gooseneck lamps:** On concrete/green posts, disc-shaped heads, basic arms; blended with trees or street furniture.\n   - **(4) Traffic-Integrated lamps:** Metallic, boxy heads, with traffic infrastructure—emphasizing space efficiency.\n\n---\n\n## ***Final Summary (Distinct Lamp Groups in Meguro, Tokyo)***\n\nStreet lamps in Meguro Ward, Tokyo, are almost universally modern, unadorned, and focused on utility. The key patterns are:\n\n1. **Modern Minimalist Lamp Poles:**  \n   Typically in dark brown/black or metallic gray, with cylindrical poles. Lamp heads may be compact cylinder or flat/rectangular, sometimes mounted directly on top, sometimes on a right-angled/L-shaped arm. Some serve as utility/telegraph/traffic signal poles.\n\n2. **Globe-Topped Lamps:**  \n   Freestanding gray/metallic poles with large round globe diffusers, providing soft area or pedestrian lighting. Poles are straight and unadorned.\n\n3. **Gooseneck or Disc-Head Lamps on Utility/Concrete Poles:**  \n   Either unpainted concrete or muted green metal poles, fitted with simple disc-shaped or compact downward-facing lamps on gently curved or straight horizontal arms. Found close to curb, often amid greenery, blending with surroundings.\n\n4. **Multi-Use Metallic Poles with Box-Style Lamp Heads:**  \n   Silver or light gray, these poles often serve multiple functions (traffic signals, signage, lighting), with compact, flat rectangular heads on cantilevered or curved arms.\n\nAll lamps in Meguro share an emphasis on unobtrusive design, prioritizing effective illumination, infrastructure integration, and maintenance practicality. There are **no ornate, historic, or decorative lamps**—all features reinforce the modern, functional, and context-blending approach typical of Tokyo’s residential and urban lighting.\n\n---\n\n**If you need a list, a visual typology, or map-key suggestions, let me know!**"
